# Sudoku
this a sudoku solver
it works by using an unfinished 9x9 sudoku board and is solved by using a back tracking algorithm
I pulled inspiratoin from the Computerphile's video on sudoku, but i did not copy his code, i would say that mine is more visually appealing. I also used documentation some check list items from W3Schools and Stack Overflow to help with debugging.
when you run the code, it will show the unfinished board, then the finished board right after.
If you want to change the board, you will have to do so in your IDE, and make sure that they are all valid. (two 8's should not be in the same row or column, etc.)

I tried my best when finishing my checklist, but some of the things that are on there are not possible with my code.
Out of the unfinished checklist items I completed: 5.7, 5.8, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5.

I was only able to to complete 1 out of the 4 advanced topics because I felt that it was too hard to implement them into my code but i hope that will provide some bolstering of my grade when considering my grade. 

Thank you for teaching me, it has been a wonder ful experience
